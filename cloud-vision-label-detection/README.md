## ##Usage

###Prerequisites

[Install Serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/)
[Set up a Google Cloud account](https://cloud.google.com/)
Sign up for a [Box Developer](https://developer.box.com/) account and prepare your app for Box skills. See our [developer documentation](https://developer.box.com/docs/box-skills) for more guidance.

###Configuring Serverless
Our Box Skill uses the excellent [Serverless framework](https://serverless.com/). This framework allows for deployment to various serverless platforms.
To use Serverless, install the NPM module.

```
npm install -g serverless
```

Next, create a Google Cloud Function. follow Serverless has a great [step-by-step guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/google/guide/quick-start/) you could follow if needed.

Clone this repo and change into the folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/box-community/sample-image-skills
```

Finally, deploy the Skill.

```
serverless deploy -v
```

At the end of this, you will have an invocation URL for your Lambda function.

###Set the invocation URL
The final step is to [configure your Box Skill with the invocation URL](https://developer.box.com/docs/configure-a-box-skill) for your serverless function. You should have received this in the previous, after you deployed the function for the first time.

Once your new Skill is called by our code, the Skill usually takes a few minutes to process and write the new metadata to the file.
