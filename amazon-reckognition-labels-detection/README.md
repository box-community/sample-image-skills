# Amazon Label Detection Skill
## Use the Amazon [Rekognition API](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) to automatically extract labels from images and add them to your image files as metadata.

Amazon Rekognition provides image and video analysis. The [DetectLabels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_DetectLabels.html) endpoint that is used in this application detects instances of real-world entities that are captured in a provided image. The data that can be returned from using this skill is usually objects, events, or concepts that are present in the image provided (see screenshots folder for example return data)

# Usage
## Prerequisites
Make sure to have an AWS account
Make sure to sign up for a Box Developer account and prepare your app for Box skills. See our developer documentation for more guidance.
Ensure that you have given your AWS identity who will be executing the skill access to the Rekognition services

You can find these settings in the Identity Access Managment (IAM) portal in the AWS console
The permissions for this user should look similar to the code below to ensure access to Rekognition has been granted.
    ```
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rekognition:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}```

## Configuring Serverless
Our Box skills uses the excellent Serverless framework. This framework allows for deployment to various serverless platforms, but in this example we will use AWS as an example.

To use Serverless, install the NPM module.

'npm install -g serverless'
Next, follow our guide on configuring Serverless for AWS, or any of the guides on serverless.com to allow deploying to your favorite serverless provider.
